# Excel Helper AI Improvements

This document outlines the recent improvements made to the Excel Helper AI application to enhance its functionality, reliability, and user experience.

## Frontend Hook Improvements

### 1. Enhanced `useChatRealtime` Hook

The `useChatRealtime` hook has been substantially improved with:

- **Robust Connection Management**: Added heartbeat mechanism to detect silent connection failures
- **Improved Reconnection Logic**: Implemented exponential backoff with jitter for more reliable reconnection
- **Detailed Connection State Tracking**: Added granular connection states (connected, connecting, reconnecting)
- **Timeout Detection**: Added connection timeout handling and verification mechanisms
- **Error Callback System**: Integrated detailed error reporting to the UI
- **Manual Reconnect Function**: Exposed a reconnect function that can be triggered by the UI

```typescript
// Example usage
const { 
  isConnected,
  isConnecting, 
  reconnect,
  connectionError,
  // ...other state and functions
} = useChatRealtime({ 
  sessionId, 
  refetch: refetchMessages,
  onConnectionChange: (connected) => {
    // Handle connection state changes
  },
  onError: (errorMessage) => {
    // Handle connection errors
  }
});
```

### 2. Enhanced `useChatMessages` Hook

The `useChatMessages` hook now includes:

- **Advanced Message Filtering**: Filter messages by role, status, time range, and file IDs
- **Message Pinning**: Pin important messages for quick reference
- **Draft Message Management**: Auto-save message drafts for recovery
- **Optimistic UI Updates**: Immediate UI updates for better user experience
- **Message Statistics**: Calculate and display message statistics
- **Enhanced Search**: Improved search functionality with multi-term matching

```typescript
// Example usage
const { 
  messages,
  filteredMessages,
  pinMessage,
  unpinMessage,
  pinnedMessages,
  filterMessages,
  currentFilter,
  saveMessageDraft,
  getDraftMessage,
  getMessageStatistics,
  // ...other state and functions
} = useChatMessages(sessionId);
```

### 3. New Example `ChatContainer` Component

A comprehensive example component demonstrates how to use these hooks together:

- Shows real-time connection status with user feedback
- Displays and manages pinned messages
- Shows message statistics
- Implements message search functionality
- Renders progress indicators for processing messages
- Handles error states with recovery options

## Database Improvements

A new database migration adds support for message pinning:

- **`message_pins` Table**: Stores user pinned messages
- **Row-Level Security**: Ensures users can only access their own pins
- **Optimized Indexes**: Improves query performance
- **Helper Functions**: Added SQL functions for common pin operations
- **Cleanup Triggers**: Automatically cleans up pins when messages are deleted

## Next Steps

Planned improvements include:

1. **Edge Function Refactoring**: 
   - Breaking down the monolithic function into smaller, specialized functions
   - Improving error handling and recovery mechanisms

2. **File Handling Improvements**:
   - Enhancing file uploading with progress tracking
   - Implementing chunking for large files

3. **AI Enhancements**:
   - Support for multi-step analyses
   - Adding "explain more" functionality for detailed insights

## Migration Guide

To apply these changes:

1. Merge the updated hooks into your codebase
2. Run the database migration to add the `message_pins` table
3. Update your components to use the new hook features

## Usage Notes

- The connection management features detect and handle network issues automatically
- Session-specific message drafts are stored in localStorage
- Message pin state is persisted in the database for future sessions
- Messages can be filtered and searched using the new filtering API
